## Configuring Discipline Settings

### Via Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
DISCIPLINE=stem          # Options: general, stem, social, humanities, medical
```

### Via Command-Line Arguments

```bash
python -m gazzali.ask "your research question" --discipline stem
```

### Via Python API

```python
from gazzali.academic_config import AcademicConfig, Discipline

config = AcademicConfig(discipline=Discipline.STEM)
modifiers = config.get_prompt_modifiers()
```

## How Discipline Settings Affect Research

### 1. Search Strategy
- **STEM**: Prioritizes technical databases, preprint servers, and experimental studies
- **Social Sciences**: Emphasizes survey data, longitudinal studies, and mixed-methods research
- **Humanities**: Focuses on primary sources, archival materials, and scholarly monographs
- **Medical**: Prioritizes clinical trials, systematic reviews, and evidence-based guidelines

### 2. Source Evaluation
Each discipline uses different criteria for assessing source quality:
- **STEM**: Reproducibility, statistical rigor, experimental controls
- **Social Sciences**: Validity, reliability, generalizability, sample representativeness
- **Humanities**: Scholarly rigor, textual evidence, interpretive depth
- **Medical**: Evidence hierarchy, clinical significance, patient outcomes

### 3. Writing Style
- **STEM**: Technical precision, passive voice for methods, numerical data emphasis
- **Social Sciences**: Balance of theory and evidence, demographic details, policy implications
- **Humanities**: Sophisticated argumentation, textual evidence, interpretive nuance
- **Medical**: Clinical terminology, outcome reporting, practice recommendations

### 4. Report Structure
Each discipline has preferred section organization and emphasis:
- **STEM**: Detailed methodology, quantitative results, error analysis
- **Social Sciences**: Theoretical framework, mixed findings, practical implications
- **Humanities**: Extended analysis, multiple interpretations, scholarly engagement
- **Medical**: Patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, evidence quality assessment

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Discipline

1. **Single-discipline research**: Choose the primary discipline (e.g., `stem` for computer science)
2. **Interdisciplinary research**: Use `general` or the dominant discipline
3. **Applied research**: Consider the application domain (e.g., `medical` for health informatics)
4. **Theoretical research**: Choose based on theoretical tradition (e.g., `humanities` for critical theory)

### Combining with Other Settings

Discipline settings work best when combined with appropriate:
- **Citation style**: APA for social sciences/medical, IEEE for STEM, MLA/Chicago for humanities
- **Output format**: Paper for comprehensive research, review for literature synthesis
- **Word count**: Adjust based on discipline norms (STEM often more concise, humanities more expansive)

### Examples

**STEM Research Example**:
```bash
python -m gazzali.ask "quantum computing error correction" \
  --discipline stem \
  --citation-style ieee \
  --output-format paper \
  --word-count 6000
```

**Social Sciences Research Example**:
```bash
python -m gazzali.ask "impact of social media on adolescent mental health" \
  --discipline social \
  --citation-style apa \
  --output-format paper \
  --word-count 8000
```

**Humanities Research Example**:
```bash
python -m gazzali.ask "postcolonial themes in contemporary literature" \
  --discipline humanities \
  --citation-style mla \
  --output-format paper \
  --word-count 10000
```

**Medical Research Example**:
```bash
python -m gazzali.ask "efficacy of immunotherapy in lung cancer treatment" \
  --discipline medical \
  --citation-style apa \
  --output-format review \
  --word-count 7000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Output doesn't match expected discipline style

**Solution**: Ensure you've set the discipline parameter correctly and that it matches your research topic. The AI may adapt style based on the specific question.

### Issue: Too much technical jargon

**Solution**: Use `general` discipline for more accessible language, or adjust the word count to allow for more explanation.

### Issue: Missing discipline-specific elements

**Solution**: Verify that academic mode is enabled (`--academic` flag) and that the discipline is set correctly.
